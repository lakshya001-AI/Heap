## Introduction

Welcome to the Heap Data Structure repository! This project provides a simple implementation of the heap data structure in various programming languages. A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. The heap property requires that the key (or value) of each node in the tree is either greater than or less than or equal to the keys of its children, depending on whether it's a max-heap or a min-heap.

Heaps are commonly used for implementing priority queues and for various sorting algorithms like heap sort. Understanding heaps is fundamental to computer science and algorithm design.

This repository aims to provide clear and well-documented implementations of the heap data structure in different programming languages, making it easy for developers to learn and use heaps in their projects.

## Usage

You can use the heap data structure provided in this repository by including the relevant source code in your project. Here's a general overview of how to use it:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the directory of your preferred programming language.

3. Include the heap implementation in your project. The specific steps may vary depending on the programming language, but typically, you'll import or include the relevant file.

4. Create a heap object, either as a max-heap or a min-heap, depending on your requirements.

5. Use the heap's methods to perform operations like inserting elements, removing elements, or extracting the top element based on the type of heap you're using.

6. Make sure to consult the documentation and comments within the code for language-specific details and usage examples.

## Implementation

This repository provides heap implementations in the following programming languages:

- [C++](cpp/)
- [Java](java/)
- [Python](python/)
- [JavaScript](javascript/)

Each language-specific directory contains the source code for the heap data structure along with usage examples in the form of code snippets or simple programs. Please refer to the specific language directory for detailed information on how to use the heap in that language.
